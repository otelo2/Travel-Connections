# Travel-Connections
NOTE: you can use ANY programming language of your choosing for this assignment!

Create Teams of max. 3 participants for this assignment. 

1) Draw a  directed graph that represents a network of flight connections between important cities in 15 different countries that include New York; 

2) Add to each connection the value of a ticket for 1 adult in US Dollars.

3)   Program the travel connections using an adjacency matrix and program a search method that finds you the route departing from and returning to the cities chosen by the user.   It is very possible that there are no direct flights between all cities, so the itinerary you produce should include the stops the traveler has to do in between. 

4) The method should return the itinerary for the complete trip and the total cost.

5) Upload the code and the screenshots of 4 sample runs, 2 of which should have cities with no direct flights- 1 document per team-
